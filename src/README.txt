In order to use this HashMap program, the main function within the HashMap class
will be executed. The delivered code has a default table size 101, but this can
either be given a different value by changing the initial call in the main function
to the value of your choosing, or set to the default value (64) by deleting creating
a new hash table with no argument. To feed this table values you can either enter
each one manually within the main function or use the TextScan class. A sample call
is already within the package. To use your own file simply change the filepath in
the initial TextScan call.
